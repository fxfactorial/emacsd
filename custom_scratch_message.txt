Semantic, Company Tips:
1) When you're in in a foreign land, say linux kernel, be sure to 
update the system headers include path, see the example on 
os-class-semantic.  
2) Semantic's jump functionality is awesome, but does require the 
extra two definitions in this init.el. Semantic alone can jump 
to definitions, do M-] to jump to a definition of a tag and M-[ 
to come back to where you were, this include #includes.  
3) Semantic is hooked up with company-mode as it's backend, so you 
can do M-Tab and get auto-completion of functions! During the 
auto-complete, do C-w to get a new temp buffer with the definition, 
F1 for more documenation if any exists, and C-s to close that temp 
buffer.  
4) Company with semantic backing it can also do headers, use M-h 
in an #include <..>.

Org-Mode Tips: 
1) C-o will insert your common defaults, its bound to a custom
function.  
2) C-e is basically the start of all export abilities.

Misc Tips: 
1) C-; is always available and will swap two buffers.  
2) You can fold code with C-c C-t, this is just in C code at the moment.
3) C-c C-c will call compile, this is also just in C code at the moment.

LaTeX Tips: 
1) LaTeX is set up with math mode already on, so doing `-<something>
gives you math macros, to get them enclosed in $$, do C-u
`-<something> 
2) C-c compiles, and hitting C-c again will open the PDF in evince.  
3) C-e gives you an easy way to make environments, its also smart 
that it remembers the last environment you made.

Helm Tips: 
1) Helm beginning KBD is C-c C-f, key one is C-c C-f i, that opens up 
Semantic Tags for that file.  
2) M-s opens up all the available gtags, nice thing is it will make 
gtags if you don't have them already.
