Semantic, Company Tips:
1) When you're in in a foreign land, say linux kernel, be sure to 
update the system headers include path, see the example on 
os-vm, which calls os-s

Org-Mode Tips: 
1) C-e is basically the start of all export abilities.

LaTeX Tips: (Basically not used since using Org-mode)
1) LaTeX is set up with math mode already on, so doing `-<something>
gives you math macros, to get them enclosed in $$, do C-u
`-<something> 
2) C-c compiles, and hitting C-c again will open the PDF in evince.  
3) C-c C-e gives you an easy way to make environments, its also smart 
that it remembers the last environment you made.
4) Doing C-c C-f C-i shows all possible things like emphasis or
bolding. For example, C-c C-f C-b provides bold, C-e provides emphasis

Helm Tips: 
1) Helm beginning KBD is C-c C-f, key one is C-c C-f i, that opens up 
Semantic Tags for that file.  
2) M-s opens up all the available gtags, nice thing is it will make 
gtags if you don't have them already.

Misc Tips: 
1) C-' is always available and will swap two buffers.  
3) C-c C-c will call compile, then do C-x ` to go to errors, if any.
4) Remember that you can sudo open a file via tramp, just try opening
as usual, just add prefix of /sudo:: and emacs will ask for password. 
5) Add prefixes to block of highlighted code with C-x r t. 
6) In C code, do C-c C-i for all those common #includes
7) You can redirect stuff in eshell directly to a buffer, like so
ls > #<buffer *scratch*>
8) Do C-c C-g to google for whatever is under point.
9) With a rectange, can add prefix to all lines with C-x r t
10) You can open emacs on a specific line of a file, like after grep
use with: emacs "+<LINE_NUMER>" "FILE_NAME" note, quotes are needed.
11) You can go back to where you last were with "C-u C-space"
12) C-return will cycle through the buffers
13) M-return toggles the full screen
14) Find all references of tag with M--
15) Similar to 1, swap buffers top and bottom with M-'
16) Pretty cool is M-\, dels white space between two words.
17) C-l l will restart point to become the top of the buffer. 
18) M-+ gives a count of lines, words and characters, pretty neat.

Python Code
1) C-c . is going to a definition.
2) C-c , is coming back from where you were.
3) M-., regular tags works but you need to use ctags with:
ctags -e -R --languages=python.

DevOps stuff
1) s3cmd uses environment variables inside zshrc, aws I think makes
its own dot file
2) do s3cmd ls to get the machines, can do s3cmd ls <specific_machine>
3) do aws redshift describe-clusters to see what clusters are out
there, everything for can do aws redshift
