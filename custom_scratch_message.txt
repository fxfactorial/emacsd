Semantic, Company Tips:
1) When you're in in a foreign land, say linux kernel, be sure to
update the system headers include path, see the example on
os-vm, which calls os-s

Org-Mode Tips:
1) C-e is basically the start of all export abilities.

LaTeX Tips: (Basically not used since using Org-mode)
1) LaTeX is set up with math mode already on, so doing `-<something>
gives you math macros, to get them enclosed in $$, do C-u
`-<something>
2) C-c compiles, and hitting C-c again will open the PDF in evince.
3) C-c C-e gives you an easy way to make environments, its also smart
that it remembers the last environment you made.
4) Doing C-c C-f C-i shows all possible things like emphasis or
bolding. For example, C-c C-f C-b provides bold, C-e provides emphasis

Helm Tips:
1) Helm beginning KBD is C-c C-f, key one is C-c C-f i, that opens up
Semantic Tags for that file.
2) M-s opens up all the available gtags, nice thing is it will make
gtags if you don't have them already.

Misc Tips:
1) C-' is always available and will swap two buffers.
3) C-c C-c will call compile, then do C-x ` to go to errors, if any.
4) Remember that you can sudo open a file via tramp, just try opening
as usual, just add prefix of /sudo:: and emacs will ask for password.
5) Add prefixes to block of highlighted code with C-x r t.
6) In C code, do C-c C-i for all those common #includes
7) You can redirect stuff in eshell directly to a buffer, like so
ls > #<buffer *scratch*>
8) Do C-c C-g to google for whatever is under point.
9) With a rectange, can add prefix to all lines with C-x r t
10) You can open emacs on a specific line of a file, like after grep
use with: emacs "+<LINE_NUMER>" "FILE_NAME" note, quotes are needed.
11) You can go back to where you last were with "C-u C-space"
12) C-return will cycle through the buffers
13) M-return toggles the full screen
14) Find all references of tag with M--
15) Similar to 1, swap buffers top and bottom with M-'
16) Pretty cool is M-\, dels white space between two words.
17) C-l l will restart point to become the top of the buffer.
18) M-+ gives a count of lines, words and characters, pretty neat.

Python Code
1) C-c . is going to a definition.
2) C-c , is coming back from where you were.
3) M-., regular tags works but you need to use ctags with:
ctags -e -R --languages=python.
4) C-c C-< will indent a region to the left.

DevOps stuff
1) s3cmd uses environment variables inside zshrc, aws I think makes
its own dot file
2) do s3cmd ls to get the machines, can do s3cmd ls <specific_machine>
3) do aws redshift describe-clusters to see what clusters are out
there, everything for can do aws redshift
4) Create arbtiary sized file:  dd if=/dev/zero of=output.dat  bs=1M  count=10

OCaml
1) #use will read, compile and execute source code given.
2) #load is like loading compiled stuff, so example:
#load "unix.cma" for libraries or #load "compiled.cmo" for an
executable.
load's path includes ~/.opam/<current_compiler>/lib/ocaml
3) #require is like loading up a package, so #require "netstring"
4) Do padding with : printf "%*s" 20 "hi";;

JavaScript
1) Using tern, go to the defintion with M-. and comeback with M-,
2) Using tern, get the type with C-c C-c
3) Hide function defintions with C-c C-f

Nix
1) source ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

ReactNative:
Cover is like use the image size as it is and make it cover the given spacing

Stretch is like take the image and make it fit the dimensions given, force it

contain is like keep the ratio for the given sizing




Notes: A tree is a graph with no loops


A geometric interpretation of the quadratic form that hasn't been
mentioned so far in the course: if x is a vector in R^n, and A is
square, then Ax is also a vector in R^n. You can think of A as a
function that changes one vector x in the space to a new vector
Ax in the space. The quadratic form x^TAx is the inner product of
the old vector x with the new vector Ax. A positive definite
matrix guarantees that this inner product is positive. But the
inner product is the product of the lengths of the two vectors, x
and Ax, and the cosine of the angle between them. Ignoring their
lengths, the fact that the quadratic form is always positive says
that the cosine of the angle between them is always positive,
which means that the angle is between -pi/2 and pi/2. Thus,
whatever A does to x, the new vector can't be more than 90
degrees away from the old vector. This is a form of stability,
not in the length of the new vector (the eigenvalues of A could
be large, so vectors could grow very large when A is applied to
them), but in the direction of the new vector.


To re-compile all packages, type
M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir nil 'force).
After restarting Emacs, packages should work fine again.
