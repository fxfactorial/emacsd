This command installs Jedi server script jediepcserver.py in a
Python environment dedicated to Emacs.  By default, the

This environment is automatically created by ``virtualenv`` if it
does not exist.

Run this command (i.e., type ``M-x jedi:install-server RET``)
whenever Jedi.el shows a message to do so.  It is a good idea to
run this every time after you update Jedi.el to sync version of
Python modules used by Jedi.el and Jedi.el itself.

You can modify the location of the environment by changing
`jedi:environment-root' and/or `python-environment-directory'.  More
specifically, Jedi.el will install Python modules under the directory
``PYTHON-ENVIRONMENT-DIRECTORY/JEDI:ENVIRONMENT-ROOT``.  Note that you
need command line program ``virtualenv``.  If you have the command in
an unusual location, use `python-environment-virtualenv' to specify the
location.

.. NOTE:: jediepcserver.py is installed in a virtual environment but it
   does not mean Jedi.el cannot recognize the modules in virtual
   environment you are using for your Python development.  Jedi
   EPC server recognize the virtualenv it is in (i.e., the
   environment variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` in your Emacs) and then
   add modules in that environment to its ``sys.path``.  You can
   also add ``--virtual-env PATH/TO/ENV`` to `jedi:server-args'
   to include modules of virtual environment even you launch
   Emacs outside of the virtual environment.

.. NOTE:: It is highly recommended to use this command to install
   Python modules for Jedi.el.  You still can install Python
   modules used by Jedi.el manually.  However, you are then
   responsible for keeping Jedi.el and Python modules compatible.

Create an empty dictionary and return it.

If NAME is supplied, the dictionary is stored in the variable
NAME. Defaults to FILENAME stripped of directory and
extension. (Regardless of the value of NAME, the dictionary will
be stored in the default variable name when it is reloaded from
file.)

FILENAME supplies a directory and file name to use when saving
the dictionary. If the AUTOSAVE flag is non-nil, then the
dictionary will automatically be saved to this file when it is
unloaded or when exiting Emacs.

If UNLISTED is non-nil, the dictionary will not be added to the
list of loaded dictionaries. Note that this disables autosaving.

COMPARE-FUNCTION sets the function used to compare elements of
the keys. It should take two arguments, A and B, both of the type
contained by the sequences used as keys (e.g. if the keys will
be strings, the function will be passed two characters). It
should return t if the first is \"less than\" the
second. Defaults to `<'.

INSERT-FUNCTION sets the function used to insert data into the
dictionary. It should take two arguments: the new data, and the
data already in the dictionary, and should return the data to
insert. Defaults to replacing any existing data with the new
data.

RANK-FUNCTION sets the function used to rank the results of
`dictree-complete'. It should take two arguments, each a cons
whose car is a dictree key (a sequence) and whose cdr is the data
associated with that key. It should return non-nil if the first
argument is \"better\" than the second, nil otherwise. It
defaults to \"lexical\" comparison of the keys, ignoring the data
\(which is not very useful, since an unranked `dictree-complete'
query already does this much more efficiently).

CACHE-POLICY should be a symbol ('time, 'length, or 'both), which
determines which query operations are cached. The 'time setting
caches queries that take longer (in seconds) than the
corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD value. The 'length setting caches
lookups of key sequences that are longer than
LOOKUP-CACHE-THRESHOLD value (since those are likely to be the
slower ones), and caches completions of prefixes that are shorter
than the corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD (since those are likely to
be the slower ones in that case). The setting 'both requires both
conditions to be satisfied simultaneously. In this case,
CACHE-THRESHOLD must be a plist with properties :time and :length
specifying the corresponding cache thresholds.

CACHE-UPDATE-POLICY should be a symbol ('synchronize or 'delete),
which determines how the caches are updated when data is inserted
or deleted. The former updates tainted cache entries, which makes
queries faster but insertion and deletion slower, whereas the
latter deletes any tainted cache entries, which makes queries
slower but insertion and deletion faster.

The CACHE-THRESHOLD settings set the threshold for caching the
corresponding dictionary query (lookup, completion, ranked
completion). The meaning of these values depends on the setting
of CACHE-POLICY (see above).

All CACHE-THRESHOLD's default to nil. The values nil and t are
special. If a CACHE-THRESHOLD is set to nil, no caching is done
for that type of query. If it is t, everything is cached for that
type of query (similar behaviour can be obtained by setting the
CACHE-THRESHOLD to 0, but it is better to use t).

KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN are functions used to
convert keys, data and property lists into lisp objects that have
a valid read syntax, for writing to file. DATA-SAVEFUN and
PLIST-SAVEFUN are used when saving the dictionary (see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write'), and all three functions are
used when dumping the contents of the dictionary (see
`dictree-dump-to-buffer' and `dictree-dump-to-file').
KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN should each accept
one argument: a key, data or property list from DICT,
respectively. They should return a lisp object which has a valid
read syntax. When defining these functions, be careful not to
accidentally modify the lisp object in the dictionary; usually,
you will need to make a copy before converting it.

KEY-LOADFUN, DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN are used to convert
keys, data and property lists back again when loading a
dictionary (only DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN, see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write') or populating it from a
file (all three, see `dictree-populate-from-file'). They should
accept one argument: a lisp object of the type produced by the
corresponding SAVEFUN, and return a lisp object to use in the
loaded dictionary.

TRIE-TYPE sets the type of trie to use as the underlying data
structure. See `trie-create' for details.

Args are SECS, REPEAT, REDOSECS, REDOREPEAT, INCLUDERUNTIME,

Suppose you want emacs to run an action every REDOSECS for as long as
emacs remains idle.  Think you can do it with the emacs' 
run-with-idle-timer? Think again.. :)   That function will perform the
action exactly once every time emacs goes idle.  This funciton, 
tf-run-with-idle-timer *will* allow you to keep performing an action
as long as emacs remains idle.

SECS is the number of seconds to wait once emacs has first gone
idle. It can really be any expression whose at runtime yields a
number..  Note that the way run-with-idle-timer is defined, SECS will
unfortunately be evalled immediately after you call this function, but
redosecs will be *every* time emacs *remains* idle..yay..


If REDOREPEAT is non-nil, the action is repeated as long emacs remains
idle.  REDOSECS is the number of additional seconds (after the action
has been done) to wait if emacs remains idle before performing the
action again.  Again, redosecs does not have to be a number, it can be
any expression whose eval yields to a number...

If INCLUDERUNTIME is non-nil, REDOSECS is the number of
additional seconds to wait after the action has been invoked (not
finished).

If REPEAT is nonnil, the entire cycle is repeated every time emacs
next goes idle.. (as in the default run-with-idle-timer.

Return a new trie that uses comparison function COMPARISON-FUNCTION.

A trie stores sequences (strings, vectors or lists) along with
associated data. COMPARISON-FUNCTION should accept two arguments,
each being an element of such a sequence, and return t if the
first is strictly smaller than the second.

The remaining keyword arguments: :CREATEFUN, :INSERTFUN, :DELETEFUN,
:LOOKUPFUN, :MAPFUN, :EMPTYFUN, :STACK-CREATEFUN, :STACK-POPFUN,
:STACK-EMPTYFUN, :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ
determine the type of trie that is created.

CREATEFUN is called as follows:

  (CREATEFUN COMPARISON-FUNCTION SEQ)

and should return a data structure (\"ARRAY\") that can be used
as an associative array, where two elements A and B are equal if
the following is non-nil:

  (and (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a)
       (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a))

The SEQ argument is a vector containing the sequence that will
correspond to the newly created array in the trie. For most types
of trie, this value is ignored. It is passed to CREATEFUN only in
order to allow the creation of \"hybrid\" trie structures, in
which different types of associative array are used in different
parts of the trie. For example, the type of associative array
could be chosen based on the depth in the trie, given by (length
SEQ). (Note that all the other functions described below must be
able to correctly handle *any* of the types of associate array
that might be created by CREATEFUN.)

INSERTFUN, DELETEFUN, LOOKUPFUN, MAPFUN and EMPTYFUN should
insert, delete, lookup, map over, and check-if-there-exist-any
elements in an associative array. They are called as follows:

  (INSERTFUN array element &optional updatefun)
  (DELETEFUN array element &optional predicate nilflag)
  (LOOKUPFUN array element &optional nilflag)
  (MAPFUN function array &optional reverse)
  (EMPTYFUN array)

INSERTFUN should insert ELEMENT into ARRAY and return the new
element, which will be ELEMENT itself unless UPDATEFUN is
specified. In that case, if and only if an element matching
ELEMENT already exists in the associative array, INSERTFUN should
instead pass ELEMENT and the matching element as arguments to
UPDATEFUN, replace the matching element with the return value,
and return that return value.

DELETEFUN should delete the element in the associative array that
matches ELEMENT, and return the deleted element. However, if
PREDICATE is specified and a matching element exists in ARRAY,
DELETEFUN should first pass the matching element as an argument
to PREDICATE before deleting, and should only delete the element
if PREDICATE returns non-nil. DELETEFUN should return NILFLAG if
no element was deleted (either becuase no matching element was
found, or because TESTFUN returned nil).

LOOKUPFUN should return the element from the associative array
that matches ELEMENT, or NILFLAG if no matching element exists.

MAPFUN should map FUNCTION over all elements in the order defined by
COMPARISON-FUNCTION, or in reverse order if REVERSE is non-nil.


STACK-CREATEFUN, STACK-POPFUN and STACK-EMPTYFUN should allow the
associative array to be used as a stack. STACK-CREATEFUN is
called as follows:

  (STACK-CREATEFUN array)

and should return a data structure (\"STACK\") that behaves like
a sorted stack of all elements in the associative array. I.e.
successive calls to

  (STACK-POPFUN stack)

should return elements from the associative array in the order
defined by COMPARISON-FUNCTION, and

  (STACK-EMPTYFUN stack)

should return non-nil if the stack is empty, nil otherwise.

The stack functions are optional, in that all trie operations
other than the stack-related ones will work correctly. However,
any code that makes use of trie-stacks will complain if supplied
with this type of trie.


The :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ arguments are
optional. If supplied, they can be used to transform the trie
into a format suitable for passing to Elisp's `print'
functions (typically used to persistently store the trie by
writing it to file), and transform from that format back to the
original usable form.


Warning: to avoid nasty dynamic scoping bugs, the supplied
functions must *never* bind any variables with names commencing
\"--\".")

Major mode for editing OCaml code.

Dedicated to Emacs and XEmacs, version 21 and higher.  Provides
automatic indentation and compilation interface. Performs font/color
highlighting using Font-Lock.  It is designed for OCaml but handles
Caml Light as well.

The Font-Lock minor-mode is used according to your customization
options.

You have better byte-compile tuareg.el.

For customization purposes, you should use `tuareg-mode-hook'
\(run for every file) or `tuareg-load-hook' (run once) and not patch
the mode itself. You should add to your configuration file something like:
  (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
               ... ; your customization code
            ))
For example you can change the indentation of some keywords, the
`electric' flags, Font-Lock colors... Every customizable variable is
documented, use `C-h-v' or look at the mode's source code.

`dot-emacs.el' is a sample customization file for standard changes.
You can append it to your `.emacs' or use it as a tutorial.

`M-x ocamldebug' FILE starts the OCaml debugger ocamldebug on the executable
FILE, with input and output in an Emacs buffer named *ocamldebug-FILE*.

A Tuareg Interactive Mode to evaluate expressions in a toplevel is included.
Type `M-x tuareg-run-ocaml' or see special-keys below.

For the best indentation experience, some elementary rules must be followed.
  - Because the `function' keyword has a special indentation (to handle
    case matches) use the `fun' keyword when no case match is performed.
  - In OCaml, `;;' is no longer necessary for correct indentation,
    except before top level phrases not introduced by `type', `val', `let'
    etc. (i.e., phrases used for their side-effects or to be executed
    in a top level.)
  - Long sequences of `and's may slow down indentation slightly, since
    some computations (few) require to go back to the beginning of the
    sequence. Some very long nested blocks may also lead to slow
    processing of `end's, `else's, `done's...
  - Multiline strings are handled properly, but you may prefer string
    concatenation `^' to break long strings (the C-j keystroke can help).
  - Comment indentation is often a matter of taste and context, yet
    sophisticated heuristics provide reasonable indentation in most cases.
    When inserting a comment right before the code it refers to, it is
    generally expected that this comment will be aligned with the folowing
    code; to enforce this, leave a blank line before the comment.

Known bugs:
  - When writing a line with mixed code and comments, avoid putting
    comments at the beginning or middle of the text. More precisely,
    writing comments immediately after `=' or parentheses then writing
    some more code on the line leads to indentation errors. You may write
    `let x (* blah *) = blah' but should avoid `let x = (* blah *) blah'.
