Example (let ((zebra 'stripes)
             (tiger 'fierce))
             (message "One kind of animal has %s and another is %s."
                      zebra tiger))
Here, the varlist is  ((zebra 'stripes) (tiger 'fierce)) .

See, using the ' makes it a literal symbol, it doesn't evaluate
it..aka doing '(concat "first" "second") doesn't actually give back
"firstsecond", it gives back the symbol '(concat "first" "second"), 
but if you drop the ', then the function will evaluate. 
(defun file-string (file)
    "Read the contents of a file and return as a string."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents file)
      (buffer-string)))
((lambda ()
   ;; notes-buffer now holds our message, 
   ;; might refactor later to with-temp-buffer?
   (let ((notes-buffer (find-file "custom_scratch_message.txt")))
     ;; Now we need to get it into the scratch buffer. 
     ;; Let's clear out the scratch buffer first. 
     (setq initial-scratch-message nil)
     (message "test %s" foo))))
